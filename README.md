To reproduce this, we recommend using Google Colab. If you have a GPU, then feel free to implement these steps locally as well.
- Open PeerReviewSubmission/CS_182_Final_Project_RNN_Style_Architecture.ipynb
- Into the accessible documents in the Colab, add PeerReviewSubmission/rj_vadr_bert.csv
- Run the colab! 

If there are data import errors, this is probably because the `csv` is not accessible. Please confirm that it is in local memory!
