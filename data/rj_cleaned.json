From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross\u2019d lovers take their life; Whose misadventur\u2019d piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents\u2019 strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark\u2019d love, And the continuance of their parents\u2019 rage, Which, but their children\u2019s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours\u2019 traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend."

If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time all the rest depart away: You, Capulet, shall go along with me, And Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.

Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursu\u2019d my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn\u2019d who gladly fled from me."

And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers\u2019 brains, and then they dream of love; O\u2019er courtiers\u2019 knees, that dream on curtsies straight; O\u2019er lawyers\u2019 fingers, who straight dream on fees; O\u2019er ladies\u2019 lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o\u2019er a courtier\u2019s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\u2019s tail, Tickling a parson\u2019s nose as a lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice: Sometime she driveth o\u2019er a soldier\u2019s neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night; And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them, and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she,\u2014"

Wilt thou slay thyself? And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives, By doing damned hate upon thyself? Why rail\u2019st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?

What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew\u2019st Tybalt; there art thou happy. The law that threaten\u2019d death becomes thy friend, And turns it to exile; there art thou happy. A pack of blessings light upon thy back; Happiness courts thee in her best array; But like a misshaped and sullen wench, Thou putt\u2019st up thy Fortune and thy love. Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed, Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her. But look thou stay not till the watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; Where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went\u2019st forth in lamentation.

No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes\u2019 windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv\u2019d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow\u2019d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover\u2019d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it."

You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth\u2019d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow\u2019d grave, Being the time the potion\u2019s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay\u2019d by accident; and yesternight Return\u2019d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred\u2019s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy.

    "speaker": "PAGE",
    "dialogue": "He came with flowers to strew his lady\u2019s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch."

    "speaker": "PRINCE",
    "dialogue": "This letter doth make good the Friar\u2019s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor \u2019pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\u2019d."

    "dialogue": "But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet."

    "speaker": "CAPULET",
    "dialogue": "As rich shall Romeo\u2019s by his lady\u2019s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity."

    "speaker": "PRINCE",
    "dialogue": "A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon\u2019d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."
